About Me
    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>As a person I am pretty nerdy, some of my hobbies consist of yugioh, magic the gathering, pokemon, digimon, and even DnD. Academiclly I want learn how to code so that I can make my own video games. I know a little html, css, and java, but havent keep it in practice to remember all for it. I also want to learn and become fluent with spanish, In high school I learned a little bit and can put sentences togther but overall my spanish is pretty garbage.</p>
